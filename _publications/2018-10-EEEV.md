title: "Velocity structure building and ground motion simulation of the 2014 Ludian Ms 6.5 Earthquake"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-10-EEEV
excerpt: 'This study constructs a 3D velocity structure model of the Ludian region in the Yunnan province, southwestern China, and simulates ground motion propagation of the 2014 Ludian Ms 6.5 earthquake. It aims to construct the local velocity structure of the Ludian region in three dimensions and with high precision. The simulation, using the spectral element method, is validated by field data from the Ludian earthquake records. Thus, it demonstrates that the adopted key parameters, such as the seismic source mechanism, propagation medium and geographical features of the engineering site, are appropriated for the simulation. Meanwhile, the simulation generates the ground motion distribution of the study region with an earthquake- induced landslide in Ludian earthquake.'
